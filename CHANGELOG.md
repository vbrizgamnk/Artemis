# Changelog
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and the format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The first release is [3.0.0] because this is actually the third major version (completely rewritten) of the software.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add support for signals with multiple-value acf ([#9](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/9)). This breaks the backward compatibility because the database changed structure.

### Fixed
- The audio buttons are of the same dimension also for high resolution screens ([#13](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/13))
- An audio sample can be paused and a different one can be played without a program crash ([#12](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/12))

## [3.0.1] - 2019-8-1
### Added
- The audio player has now a loop button ([#3](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/3)).
- The project has now a Changelog file.

### Fixed
- Added SSL certificates for all downloads. Avoid a crash of the program for certain systems ([#6](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/6)).
- Start the application in maximized mode. The label in the propagation data are well displayed ([#7](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/7)).
- Compile the executable for Linux on an older version to avoid GLIBC compatibilities issues ([#8](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/pull/8)).

## [3.0.0] - 2019-07-23
First release.
