## ARTEMIS 3 .SPEC FILES

Artemis 3 .spec files are used by the package **pyinstaller** (https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to build a single standalone executable (or a one-dir package). The extreme versatility of this package is the fact that every external dependency is already embedded into the bundle. The interpreter of Python 3 is also included.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7.0+
- Pyinstaller
- 
**IMPORTANT:** *To generate the standalone and the one-dir package, you must use an operating system that coincides with the target one (pyinstaller doesn't allow cross-compilation).* 

## Package Building (standalone aka one-file, high portability, **suggested**)
1. Download a fresh copy of the git repository.
2. Choose the target OS in `spec_files` folder and copy the whole content (except the Artemis_onedir.spec file) into `src`
3. Open a terminal into `src` and run:
```
pyinstaller Artemis.spec
```
4. Copy the `src/themes` folder into `src/dist`.
5. The ready-to-use compiled software is now present into `src/dist` folder.

## Package Building (one-dir, shorter startup time, low portability)
1. Download a fresh copy of the git repository.
2. Choose the target OS in `spec_files` folder and copy the whole content (except the Artemis.spec file) into `src`
3. Open a terminal into `src` and run:
```
pyinstaller Artemis_onedir.spec
```
4. Copy the `src/themes` folder into `src/dist/Artemis`.
5. The ready-to-use compiled software is now present into `src/dist` folder as a bundle. All the libraries are clearly present.
